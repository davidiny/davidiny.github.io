I am a Ph.D candidate at Johns Hopkins University in the department of Computer Science advised by [Aviel Rubin](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/aviel-rubin/) and [Tushar Jois](https://tjo.is).  My research focuses on ways of applying cryptography to create anonymous and privacy preserving communication systems and tools.

I earned my M.S. in Information Technology-Information Security and my B.S. in Information Systems from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu).  After graduating, I worked at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/documentcloud.html) as a security researcher for the Document Cloud.  In my free time, I enjoy tutoring high-school students interested in pursuing cybersecurity careers through [LognCoding](https://www.logncoding.com/index.html) as well as performing security consulting.  I'm also working on building next-gen cybersecurity tools at [TanDev](https://tandev.us).
