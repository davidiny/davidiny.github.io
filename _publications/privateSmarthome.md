excerpt: 'We propose a virtual smart home hub that replaces centralized cloud control and physical hubs, which pose privacy and reliability risks. Our system uses secure multiparty computation to let users define smart home automation without exposing device data or relying on a single point of failure.'

As smart homes grow in popularity, the challenge of preserving security and privacy while managing network communications between the IoT devices involved is ever present. While current solutions include cloud controlled networks, which ultimately pose privacy risks, and physical smart home hubs, which introduce a single point of failure, we propose another option: a virtual smart home hub. In this paper we lay the groundwork for a system through which users can describe a smart home configuration with device inputs passed into a secure multiparty computation, creating a means for automation without a centralized hub.
