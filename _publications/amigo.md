excerpt: 'Protesters can now stay connected even when the internet is shut down, thanks to Amigo, a clever mesh messaging system that keeps chats secure and anonymous in chaotic, protest-like conditions. Unlike older systems, Amigo handles the messy, real-world challenges of unreliable connections and large groups with smart routing and continuous key agreement.'

In large-scale protests, a repressive government will often disable the Internet to thwart communication between protesters. Smartphone mesh networks, which route messages over short range, possibly ephemeral, radio connections between nearby phones, allow protesters to communicate without relying on centralized Internet infrastructure. Unfortunately, prior work on mesh networks does not efficiently support cryptographically secure group messaging (a crucial requirement for protests); prior networks were also evaluated in unrealistically benign network environments which fail to accurately capture the link churn and physical spectrum contention found in realistic protest environments. In this paper, we introduce Amigo, an anonymous mesh messaging system which supports group communication through continuous key agreement, and forwards messages using a novel routing protocol designed to handle the challenges of ad-hoc routing scenarios. Our extensive simulations reveal the poor scalability of prior approaches, the benefits of the Amigo protest-specific optimizations, and the challenges that still must be solved to scale secure mesh networks to protests with thousands of participants.
